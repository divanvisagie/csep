# csep
Cosine Similarity Embeddings Print

Like Grep (Global Regular Expression Print) takes a regular expression and
prints all the lines that have a match in it, Csep (Cosine Similarity Embeddings
Print) takes an input phrase and prints all the chunks that are similar to it.

The goal of this project is to give users command line access to semantic search
in the same way that grep is used for regular expressions. This not only gives
you full control over a command line semantic search on any unix like system,
but also allows you to use it in scripts and pipelines, if you combine it with a
command line llm tool like
[chat-gipity](https://github.com/divanvisagie/chat-gipity) or Ollama you could
even potentially perform rag in a simple unix shell script.
