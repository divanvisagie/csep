The Rust crate `text-splitter` could be a good starting point for chunking text into smaller segments before processing them further, such as generating embeddings. This crate is designed to split text into parts that are under a certain length without cutting words in half. It's particularly useful for message segmentation in applications like SMS or tweets where there's a strict character limit.

Here’s how you might use the `text-splitter` crate:

1. **Add to Cargo.toml**:
   First, add `text-splitter` to your `Cargo.toml` file to include it in your project:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   text-splitter = "0.1.2"
   ```

2. **Using text-splitter**:
   Here's an example of how to use `text-splitter` to break a longer text into chunks of a specified maximum length:
   ```rust
   extern crate text_splitter;

   fn main() {
       let text = "This is a sample text that needs to be split into smaller segments that each have a maximum length. This ensures that the chunks are manageable for further processing.";
       let max_length = 50; // Maximum length of each chunk

       let chunks = text_splitter::split_into(text, max_length);
       for chunk in chunks {
           println!("{}", chunk);
       }
   }
   ```
   This code will print each chunk of the text, ensuring that no chunk exceeds the specified length of 50 characters, and that words are not split across chunks.

This crate doesn’t perform semantic chunking (based on meaning or syntax), but it does provide a useful utility for dividing text into size-constrained parts, which can then be processed further, possibly by adding NLP features like POS tagging or semantic analysis using other tools or services.

For semantic chunking, you’d still need to integrate or implement additional NLP functionalities, possibly by combining `text-splitter` with other libraries or external APIs capable of handling more complex language processing tasks.
